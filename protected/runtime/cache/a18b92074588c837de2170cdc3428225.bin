The Singapore-based startup provides a service similar to Zipcar, except car owners rent out their own vehicles and iCarsClub doesn&#8217;t own or provide the cars. The company will install a piece of hardware in members&#8217; vehicles, which will allow the renter to unlock the doors with a phone app. The cars are connected to a central server which sends the locking command. iCarsClub was just launched in December, and the team is using its home state of Singapore to test the concept. The team of five have plans to quickly expand to China within the year, and are eyeing Beijing and Shanghai. It has set a target to attract 5,000 members and 1,000 cars in Singapore, and another 1,000 cars in China by end-year. The startup was funded by Red Dot Ventures, a VC in Singapore affiliated with the government&#8217;s National Research Foundation (NRF) effort. The NRF backs investments pledged by its appointed VCs in the country, to a ratio of 85 percent for 15 percent raised by the VCs. iCarsClub&#8217;s CEO is Eddy Zhang, and the team includes Joya Zhao Hong, Chengkun Xue and Jack Wei Liuwei.";}i:1;a:3:{s:4:"link";s:57:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/lxqP5kLR6I8/";s:5:"title";s:88:"Online Gaming Company Bigpoint Appoints New CEO In The Face Of Industry “Transition”";s:4:"desc";s:903:"<img width="100" height="64" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/bigpoint.png?w=100&amp;h=64&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="BigPoint" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bigpoint.com">Bigpoint</a>, the European free-to-play online gaming company that is thought to have <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/bigpoint">raised</a> $460 million since 2002, is finally announcing a new CEO.

I’m not complaining that I’ll soon be able to access Spotify through my browser. But why is Spotify, well established streaming music juggernaut that it is, using its resources to make this happen? In other words, does Spotify need a web player? It isn’t as if there are a growing number of Chromebook users out there that are just itching to get their streaming music action on. A new report released Monday revealed that Chromebooks accounted for only 0.07% of desktop and laptop web traffic. The fruit there isn&#8217;t ripe for picking. In fact, the fruit there hasn’t even started growing at all. Spotify’s main competitor in this space, Rdio, runs completely off desktop, mobile, and web applications. But the notion that Rdio is scaring Spotify into making a play in this web player space is laughable. AppData’s monthly estimates peg Rdio’s active monthly users at over 300,000. In comparison, Spotify currently boasts around 20 million. And yet, of course Spotify needs a web application. Having Spotify on the browser isn’t just about appeasing a few Chromebook users or sticking it in the face of Rdio. It’s about accessibility anywhere on the world on any platform with an Internet connection. Spotify has already squashed its competitors in the music streaming world. Next, it’s setting its sights on the web. For example, take Spotify’s Play Button. The Play Button is a widget that can be embedded in any news site to provide easy access to Spotify’s tracks and playlists. You’ve probably come across it yourself plenty of times since we detailed its functions last April. But for users without Spotify’s desktop application, clicking on the Play Button simply redirects to Spotify’s download page. Well then, why is that a problem? After all, the app is a free download and if you don’t mind ads, you can stream music for free too. The limitations of having Spotify accessible only from desktop and mobile applications stretch well beyond Chromebook and Linux users. As our very own Josh Constine noted in his hands on of the Spotify web player beta, there are plenty of work, school, and other public computers that you can’t install software on.

That, however, didn&#8217;t stop MPEG LA, the guardians of the H.264 patent and license, from looking into creating a patent pool in 2011 and potentially suing Google for patent infringement upon its competing codec. Today, however, MPEG LA and Google announced that they have come to an agreement. MPEG LA will grant Google a license &#8220;to techniques that may be essential to VP8 and earlier-generation VPx video compression technologies under patents owned by 11 patent holders.&#8221; The agreement allows Google to sub-license the techniques covered by the agreement to any VP8 user and also covers the next generation of the VPx codec. As part of this deal, MPEG LA is discontinuing its efforts to form a VP8 patent pool. Chances are Google had to pay for this license, but the financial details of the agreement were not disclosed. “We are pleased for the opportunity to facilitate agreements with Google to make VP8 widely available to users.&#8221; MPEG LA President and CEO Larry Horn. The relative uncertainty around VP8 definitely hindered its adoption outside of Google. Microsoft, for example, decided to keep the Google-backed WebM media file format that was built around VP8 out of its browser because of this uncertainty. The WebRTC standard, however, which most browser vendors have now adopted, is built around the VP8 codec. “This is a significant milestone in Google’s efforts to establish VP8 as a widely deployed web video format,” said Allen Lo, Google’s deputy general counsel for patents, in a statement today. Despite Google&#8217;s efforts, H.264 remains the de facto standard for video codecs. The fact that it is build into WebRTC (and that the standard doesn&#8217;t allow for alternative codecs) is a boon for proponents of open standards. Now that the uncertainty around VP8 is out of the way, Microsoft may even decide to adopt WebRTC for Internet Explorer instead of its own version of the standard. For the time being, however, this virtually no support for hardware-based VP8 encoders and decoders, while virtually every video-enabled device can handle H.264 without taxing the CPU. With both the next-gen H.265 standards and Google&#8217;s VP9 codecs already in the works, today&#8217;s agreement could mean we&#8217;ll see more competition in the video codec space in the coming months.
