The data could, for example, make it easier to find out if two web sites are talking about the same person or concept, Google says. In total, the corpus features 40 million disambiguated mentions found within 10 million web pages. This, Google notes, makes it &#8220;over 100 times bigger than the next largest corpus,&#8221; which features less than 100,000 mentions. For Google, of course, disambiguation is something that is a core feature of the Knowledge Graph project, which allows you to tell Google whether you are looking for links related to the planet, car or chemical element when you search for &#8216;mercury,&#8217; for example. It takes a large corpus like this one and the ability to understand what each web page is really about to make this happen. To construct this data set, Google looked at links to Wikipedia pages &#8220;where the anchor text of the link closely matches the title of the target Wikipedia page.&#8221; There is a high probability, that this anchor text is a mention of the corresponding entity that&#8217;s the focus of the entity that&#8217;s discussed in the Wikipedia entry. The 10 million annotated web pages, sadly, aren&#8217;t part of the corpus because of copyright issues, but the UMass Wikilinks project features all the necessary tools to create this data from scratch. The UMass team also published a paper that explains the process that was used to create this data set in more detail (PDF). Last year, Google released a similar data set when it launched a database with over 7.5 million concepts and 175 million unique text strings that is similar to what Google itself uses to suggest targeted keywords for advertisers. That set, too, was built by looking at Wikipedia articles to identify concepts and the anchor links that other websites used to link to them.";}i:4;a:3:{s:4:"link";s:57:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/8vFrFuCs7Cw/";s:5:"title";s:87:"Wrike Launches A Mobile Gantt Chart With Syncing So Everyone Can See The Latest Updates";s:4:"desc";s:687:"<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/logowrike.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="logowrike" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><a target="_blank" href="http://wrike.com">Wrike</a> has added a type of chart that most seasoned project managers depend on for their work.

Fradin told me that VoiceStorm is functionally similar to Dynamic Signal's existing platform, which helps companies run word-of-mouth marketing campaigns — it's just built for employees rather than customers or fans. Basically, Fradin aims to replace all those team emails and in-person encounters where someone is nudging everyone else into tweeting something, posting it on Facebook, and so on.";}i:9;a:3:{s:4:"link";s:57:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/dtFcImIE9Jo/";s:5:"title";s:55:"Facebook Barely Poked Snapchat, Active Usage Data Shows";s:4:"desc";s:2687:"<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/inigo-montoya.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="inigo-montoya" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" />After initially missing the boat on mobile-photo sharing and then having to turn around and plunk down nearly $1 billion for Instagram, Facebook wasn&#8217;t going to let a hot app (and potential existential threat) emerge too quickly again. Although Facebook is more than 1 billion users strong, the company still has a paranoia and mortal fear that the next social network could emerge out of a distant dorm room. With promising engagement and growth metrics, Snapchat had quietly piqued some interest about a year ago before entering a hyper-growth phase with about 5 billion photos sent in a year plus $13.5 million in funding led by Benchmark Capital. By late last year, Snapchat was sending 50 million photos a day compared to 300 million photos posted on Facebook per day. Facebook responded much faster this time with an app called Poke that they built in about 12 days. It had extras like the ability to send simple text messages, in addition to video and photos. It also allowed group conversations. But for many reasons, a Facebook clone does not a startup killer make. Data on the active usage for both apps showed that Snapchat actually grew in market share from December to January after Facebook Poke&#8217;s launch. It then leveled off into February, while Facebook Poke has declined from a 2 percent market share down to less than 0.25 percent among iPhone users in the U.S. A Sequoia-backed startup called Onavo has a panel of a few million users that it samples active usage data for apps from. Because the company&#8217;s products track data compression, they can actually see the &#8220;market share&#8221; of different apps &#8212; or what percentage of iPhone owners in the U.S. used them in the last month. So as you can see below, their data suggests that 12 percent of U.S. iPhone users opened up Snapchat in February. Facebook has a mixed track record of competing against what it considers emerging threats. It has had successes like Messenger, which the company launched after buying Beluga. But on the other hand, it bought Instagram after it looked like a Facebook Camera app was going to come out too late in the market to be competitive. It shut down Quora-competitor Questions after about two years. It shut down a &#8220;Deals&#8221; product after exploring the super-competitive group buying space and Foursquare didn&#8217;t decline after Facebook launched its own &#8220;check-in&#8221; product.";}i:10;a:3:{s:4:"link";s:57:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/yie73Tky0Xc/";s:5:"title";s:66:"Hacker Steals $12,000 Worth Of Bitcoins In Brazen DNS-Based Attack";s:4:"desc";s:532:"<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/images.jpeg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="images" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" />A <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> brokerage, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bitinstant.com">Bitinstant</a> was hit by hackers who used a bit of social engineering to take control of the company's DNS servers and ultimately funnel out $12,000 worth of Bitcoins.

Setup is drop dead simple - to add a component you simply press one or two buttons on the new device and everything "just works" and the remote control UI, refined over most of the past decade, has a cult-like following. You can create different audio zones around your room and play different music in each one or enter party mode and turn your house into a massive disco. In short, Sonos makes whole-home audio easy.
