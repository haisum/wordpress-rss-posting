(Of Course It Does)";s:4:"desc";s:2671:"<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/spotify_logo_web_1359370c.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="spotify_logo_web_1359370c" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" />News broke out today that Spotify would be making a beta version of its web player available to all of its users in the UK, with the promise that a full release would come later this year. I’m not complaining that I’ll soon be able to access Spotify through my browser. But why is Spotify, well established streaming music juggernaut that it is, using its resources to make this happen? In other words, does Spotify need a web player? It isn’t as if there are a growing number of Chromebook users out there that are just itching to get their streaming music action on. A new report released Monday revealed that Chromebooks accounted for only 0.07% of desktop and laptop web traffic. The fruit there isn&#8217;t ripe for picking. In fact, the fruit there hasn’t even started growing at all. Spotify’s main competitor in this space, Rdio, runs completely off desktop, mobile, and web applications. But the notion that Rdio is scaring Spotify into making a play in this web player space is laughable. AppData’s monthly estimates peg Rdio’s active monthly users at over 300,000. In comparison, Spotify currently boasts around 20 million. And yet, of course Spotify needs a web application. Having Spotify on the browser isn’t just about appeasing a few Chromebook users or sticking it in the face of Rdio. It’s about accessibility anywhere on the world on any platform with an Internet connection. Spotify has already squashed its competitors in the music streaming world. Next, it’s setting its sights on the web. For example, take Spotify’s Play Button. The Play Button is a widget that can be embedded in any news site to provide easy access to Spotify’s tracks and playlists. You’ve probably come across it yourself plenty of times since we detailed its functions last April. But for users without Spotify’s desktop application, clicking on the Play Button simply redirects to Spotify’s download page. Well then, why is that a problem? After all, the app is a free download and if you don’t mind ads, you can stream music for free too. The limitations of having Spotify accessible only from desktop and mobile applications stretch well beyond Chromebook and Linux users. As our very own Josh Constine noted in his hands on of the Spotify web player beta, there are plenty of work, school, and other public computers that you can’t install software on.

That, however, didn&#8217;t stop MPEG LA, the guardians of the H.264 patent and license, from looking into creating a patent pool in 2011 and potentially suing Google for patent infringement upon its competing codec. Today, however, MPEG LA and Google announced that they have come to an agreement. MPEG LA will grant Google a license &#8220;to techniques that may be essential to VP8 and earlier-generation VPx video compression technologies under patents owned by 11 patent holders.&#8221; The agreement allows Google to sub-license the techniques covered by the agreement to any VP8 user and also covers the next generation of the VPx codec. As part of this deal, MPEG LA is discontinuing its efforts to form a VP8 patent pool. Chances are Google had to pay for this license, but the financial details of the agreement were not disclosed. “We are pleased for the opportunity to facilitate agreements with Google to make VP8 widely available to users.&#8221; MPEG LA President and CEO Larry Horn. The relative uncertainty around VP8 definitely hindered its adoption outside of Google. Microsoft, for example, decided to keep the Google-backed WebM media file format that was built around VP8 out of its browser because of this uncertainty. The WebRTC standard, however, which most browser vendors have now adopted, is built around the VP8 codec. “This is a significant milestone in Google’s efforts to establish VP8 as a widely deployed web video format,” said Allen Lo, Google’s deputy general counsel for patents, in a statement today. Despite Google&#8217;s efforts, H.264 remains the de facto standard for video codecs. The fact that it is build into WebRTC (and that the standard doesn&#8217;t allow for alternative codecs) is a boon for proponents of open standards. Now that the uncertainty around VP8 is out of the way, Microsoft may even decide to adopt WebRTC for Internet Explorer instead of its own version of the standard. For the time being, however, this virtually no support for hardware-based VP8 encoders and decoders, while virtually every video-enabled device can handle H.264 without taxing the CPU. With both the next-gen H.265 standards and Google&#8217;s VP9 codecs already in the works, today&#8217;s agreement could mean we&#8217;ll see more competition in the video codec space in the coming months. Mostly, though, this agreement takes";}i:15;a:3:{s:4:"link";s:57:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/z2aweXWWwgI/";s:5:"title";s:105:"“In The Studio,” FLOODGATE’S Mike Maples Maintains An Outsider Mindset Despite His Valley Successes";s:4:"desc";s:522:"<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/floodgate.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="FLOODGATE" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" />"In the Studio" welcomes a co-founder of a company which went public, a native Texan who studied engineering in Silicon Valley and business on the east coast, and who, upon returning to the Valley to begin investing, encountered a different path than he originally anticipated.";}i:16;a:3:{s:4:"link";s:57:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/1GDvENRo6nI/";s:5:"title";s:67:"Hands-On With The New Facebook And Its Boredom-Killing Feeds [TCTV]";s:4:"desc";s:651:"<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/facebook-tour.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Facebook Tour" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" />There's always something else to browse on the redesigned Facebook unveiled today.

Microsoft&#8217;s EP0845124 patent in Europe is for a &#8220;computer system for identifying local resources and method therefor&#8221; and was issued in 1996. The issue was discussed in a regional court in Munich today and as Mueller notes, it doesn&#8217;t look like Google was able to convince the judge &#8220;that the patent is highly probable to be invalidated at the end of a parallel nullity proceeding.&#8221; If Microsoft wins the injunction it is asking for, Google could have to shut down its mapping service in Germany, both on the web and on mobile phones (or at least on all of its own Motorola phones). In the worst of all cases, it could even be ordered to stop distributing Chrome in Germany unless it blocks access to Google Maps from the browser. The more likely option, however, as the German press agency DPA reports, is that Microsoft could offer Google a license for its patent. A Microsoft spokesperson told DPA that this could be &#8220;a way to end this war.&#8221; Google&#8217;s lawyers also argued that Google Maps is too important and shouldn&#8217;t just be shut down. Currently, about 4 million Germans use the service, and shutting down access to it for anybody with a German IP address would not just inconvenience them but also hurt Google&#8217;s image. For now, Google is keeping its cool (at least in public). A Google spokesperson gave us this statement: &#8220;“We are confident in our position and look forward to defending it in court.” FOSS Patents&#8217; Mueller also reports that Google&#8217;s counsel argued that the company would &#8220;suffer irreparable harm if it had to shut down a key part of its Google Maps service in Germany and that customers who then use competing services (such as Microsoft&#8217;s Bing Maps, which Judge Dr. Zigann mentioned) may never return to Google Maps.&#8221; All those Germans who decided to hide their houses on Google Maps&#8217; Street View will probably cheer for Microsoft to win this injunction.
