Introduction to Wordpress Rss Poster
======

I am a lazy specie. As soon as some tasks start consuming my time, I start thinking about automating them. A few days ago I realized I had a lot of rss feeds coming in my google reader if I could just summarize this treasure of fresh content and publish it on my blog I would have a lot of interesting stuff on my site.

But, I didn't want to read posts on google reader, summarize them, create new posts on wp admin and publish them one by one. So I ended up creating this project. This is similar to Google reader, you create categories, save feed links in those categories. This app, fetches fresh feeds for you, lists them and allows you to edit, select wordpress category, tags and new title and publish them to wordpress.
